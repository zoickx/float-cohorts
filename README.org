* Reasoning behind the rewrite
** Two major design flaws render this project unusable in many circumstanes:
- The basic float type is defined with an integer mantissa. Two problems with that:
  - Unnecessary complications around zero in lemmas in general
  - Incompatibility with the constructors of the ~S754_float~ type
    In a finite number mantissa is always positive; zero is rendered as a separate special constructor
    This means that there cannot exist a direct correspondence between ~float~ and ~S754_finite~
- The conversion functions are not modular enough
  For example, there is no way of defining something like ~maximize_mantissa~
** Since Coq 8.11, float support is integrated
There is no need for to depend on Flocq anymore
